  // in order to report analytics, you'll first have to provide the hostname,
  // client id and secret you have configured via the Pirsch dashboard.
  hostname: "<hostname>",
  id: "<client_id>",
  secret: "<client_secret or access_key>",
  // filter out any requests that that you do not wish to track
  // i.e. favicon.ico, fonts, etc.
  filter: (req) => !req.url.includes("favicon.ico"),
};

  plugins: [
