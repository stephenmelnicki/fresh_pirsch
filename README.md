const options: PirschPluginOptions = {
  // in order to report analytics, you'll first have to provide the hostname
  // and access key you have configured via the Pirsch dashboard.
  hostname: "<hostname>",
  accessToken: "<access_key>",
  // "http" or "https" (will default to https)
  protocol: "https",
  // filter out any requests that that you don't want to track
  // i.e. favicon.ico, fonts, etc.
  filter: (req) => !req.url.includes("favicon.ico"),
};

export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [
    // ...
    pirschPlugin(options),
  ],
